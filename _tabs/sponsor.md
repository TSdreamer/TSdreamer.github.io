# Support & Collaboration

This site documents independent research across energy systems, electrochemical technologies, and applied modelling. All content—analysis, writing, and technical infrastructure—is developed and maintained as part of ongoing work in these fields.

Where relevant, selective collaboration with industry partners informs specific projects.

## Collaboration

**Industry & Project Partnerships**  
For discussions on energy systems consulting, techno-economic analysis, or joint research initiatives:  
→ [TianSu Energy](https://www.tsuenergy.com)

**Academic & Technical Exchange**  
Open to conversations on PEM electrolysis, hydrogen economics, multi-energy system optimisation, or related topics. Reach out via the contact details on the main site.

## Support

If you find the research or resources here useful, there are a few optional ways to contribute:

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/Tianyima06) | Direct support for independent research |
| [Taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?abbucket=20&id=757057832446&spm=a230r.7195193.1997079397.6.79b73e0bdXJ062) | Product & resource links |

Support is appreciated but never expected.

## Engage

Reading, citing, or exchanging ideas already constitutes meaningful engagement.

This space exists to connect with others working on **energy transition infrastructure**, **electrochemical system design**, and **techno-economic decision-making**.

If there is alignment in interests or objectives, collaboration is welcome.

## Overview

Over the recent period, I had the opportunity to participate in **two international conferences**, focusing on complementary aspects of **energy systems, electrochemical storage, and infrastructure resilience**.


::contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}


These meetings provided a useful platform to exchange ideas, present ongoing work, and place current research in the context of real-world energy system deployment.

## Conference 1: IET – Data-Centre Energy Resilience

**:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} (IET) Conference**

I presented work titled:

**Multiscale Modelling and Optimisation of Hybrid Energy Storage Systems for Data-Centre Resilience**

The discussion centred on how hybrid battery–hydrogen energy storage systems can improve the flexibility and robustness of data centres under uncertain operating conditions, with an emphasis on modelling, optimisation, and system-level trade-offs relevant to critical digital infrastructure.

## Conference 2: SPIES 2025 – Electrochemical Hydrogen Systems

**:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}**  
The 7th International Conference on Smart Power & Internet Energy Systems  
📍 Shanghai, China | 🗓 October 17–20, 2025  

At SPIES 2025, I will present:

**Electrochemical Modelling and Experimental Validation of Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysers for Loss Decomposition**

This work focuses on electrochemical modelling and experimental validation of PEM water electrolysers, with particular attention to understanding and decomposing efficiency losses and their implications for system integration.

## Closing Note

Together, these two conferences offered a concise snapshot of current challenges across **data-centre resilience** and **electrochemical hydrogen systems**, and helped clarify the next technical steps toward practical, scalable energy solutions.

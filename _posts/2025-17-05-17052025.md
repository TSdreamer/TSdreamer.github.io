## Overview

### Project Title

**From Sun to Hydrogen: UCL–SJTU Joint Platform for Thermally-Boosted Green Hydrogen Production**

### Lead Applicants

- **UCL:** Dr. Georgios Nikiforidis  
  Lecturer, Institute for Materials Discovery, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of MAPS  
  Expertise: Electrochemical materials and electrolyser systems

- **SJTU:** Prof. Yanjun Dai  
  Head, Department of Power and Energy Engineering  
  Expertise: Thermodynamic cycles, solar thermal systems, heat pumps

---

## Project Rationale

Hydrogen is critical for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors. Despite advances, solar-powered electrolysis systems remain under-explored, especially in thermally-integrated configurations.

This **UCL–SJTU partnership** combines:

- **UCL:** Electrolyser testing platform fabrication, catalyst-coated membrane studies, and dynamic operational validation.
- **SJTU:** System-level design and simulation of integrated photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) with PEM electrolysis, leveraging heat pump coupling to enhance system efficiency.

*Methodology Applided for this Funding Application*



The collaboration targets:

- Improving energy conversion efficiency under real solar input
- Demonstrating a replicable model for international R&D collaboration
- Aligning with the UK Hydrogen Strategy and China’s clean energy transition goals

---

## Technical Highlights

- **UCL Activities**
  - Development of a modular PEM electrolyser testbed
  - Dynamic performance evaluation under simulated solar profiles
  - Experimental validation of catalyst-coated membranes and porous transport layers

- **SJTU Activities**
  - Design and simulation of thermally-integrated PVT–PEM systems
  - Heat pump integration for waste heat recovery and efficiency enhancement
  - Control strategy development for thermal-electrical subsystem matching

### Collaborative Workflow

1. UCL generates empirical data for SJTU’s simulation calibration  
2. SJTU provides system-level optimisation results to refine UCL test protocols  
3. Iterative feedback loop to integrate materials-level findings with system engineering

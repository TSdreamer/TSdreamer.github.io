## Project Rationale

Hydrogen is a critical vector for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors. Despite advances in electrochemical hydrogen production, integration with solar thermal inputs remains underexplored, particularly in thermally-integrated PEM electrolysis systems.

This **UCL–SJTU collaboration** combines:

- **UCL:** Development of electrochemical testbeds for PEM electrolyser operation, catalyst-coated membrane fabrication, and dynamic characterisation under thermal-electrical coupling scenarios.
- **SJTU:** System-level design and simulation of photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) integrated PEM electrolysis platforms with heat pump coupling to enhance thermal utilisation and overall system efficiency.

*Methodology applied for this funding application.*

The collaboration aims to:

- Increase thermal-electrochemical conversion efficiency under variable solar conditions
- Demonstrate replicable frameworks for electrochemical system integration research
- Support the UK Hydrogen Strategy and China’s clean energy transition objectives

## Technical Highlights

### UCL Work Packages

- Development of modular PEM electrolyser test platforms with integrated thermal control
- Dynamic performance evaluation under simulated solar-thermal input profiles
- Experimental characterisation of catalyst-coated membranes and porous transport layers under thermal gradients

### SJTU Work Packages

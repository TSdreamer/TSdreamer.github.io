## Overview

This post documents an ongoing research collaboration with **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, centred on **energy storage systems, power-system optimisation, and energy governance**.  
The collaboration is aligned with the system-level and policy-facing dimensions of **Chapter 6 of my PhD thesis**, which focuses on uncertainty-aware optimisation and resilience-oriented design of hybrid energy storage systems.

## Collaborating Researcher

### **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}**

**Think Tank Core Member / Researcher**  
Energy Governance Team, Energy Internet Research Institute  
Tsinghua University

Dr. Meng Yao received his B.S. degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2012), M.S. degree from Zhejiang University (2015), and Ph.D. degree from North Carolina State University (2019). He previously served as a Research Staff Member at the China Electric Power Planning and Engineering Institute.

His research interests include:

- Low-carbon and energy policy analysis  
- Power-system operation with energy storage  
- Distribution system analysis  
- Optimal planning of power and energy systems

## Collaboration Focus

The collaboration connects **technical optimisation models** with **policy and governance-oriented analysis**, with emphasis on:

- Cost–benefit assessment of energy storage in power-system operation  
- The role of storage in regulation services and system flexibility  
- Planning and operational trade-offs under market and policy constraints  
- Implications of uncertainty-aware system design for energy governance  

This perspective complements my thesis work on **hybrid electrochemical energy storage systems**, extending it from infrastructure-scale resilience modelling toward **decision-making, regulation, and long-term system planning**.

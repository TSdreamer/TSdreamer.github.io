## Overview

It was a pleasure to take part in discussions related to the **CATL Top-Talent Programme** hosted at the **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**.  
The ongoing work presented on **sustainable energy systems** and **advanced electrochemical technologies** provides a solid foundation for the development of next-generation energy infrastructure.

## Research Focus

My current research focuses on:

- **Battery-management systems (BMS)**  
- **Energy-intelligence architectures** for complex energy assets  
- Integration of **physics-based electrochemical models** with **data-driven and AI-enhanced methods**

The objective is to improve reliability, efficiency, and scalability of future energy systems, spanning from cell-level behaviour to system-level operation.

## Academic Exchange

The opportunity to exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners working across **materials development, modelling, control, and large-scale applications** was valuable, particularly in aligning fundamental research with deployment-oriented challenges.

I would like to acknowledge **Dr. Yang Mo**, **Dr. Yingzhi Sun**, **Dr. Yuqi Chen**, and **Xinyi Yang** for their coordination and organisation of the event, as well as **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} (CATL)** for the invitation and support.
